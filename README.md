# jTox
JTox is a chat application I started writing a few years ago. It was going to use the Tox library, but was never finished. It shows some skills with: Java, JavaFX, JDBC, SQLite, and gradle.

## Build/Run Instructions:
**Linux**:

```
git clone https://github.com/abueide/jTox.git
cd jTox
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

**Windows**
```
git clone https://github.com/abueide/jTox.git
cd jTox
gradlew.bat build
gradlew.bat run
```
